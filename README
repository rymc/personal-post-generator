I prefer to maintain my personal website in HTML directly. While it's not as elegant as a static site generator, or as powerful of a system as django (hello me 10 years ago), it's simple and works. However, I have a lot of URLS on the web that point to specific blog posts I've written (back when using django) and I'd prefer to keep the links working (link rot is sad). Therefore, this simple script is a compromise. It will take my blog.html, find all posts, create a new HTML page for each post and add a hyperlink to each. It generates a new index.html for my blog, and a directory of posts for each blog entry. Simple.
